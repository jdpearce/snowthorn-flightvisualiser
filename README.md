Based originally on https://github.com/richiecarmichael/Esri-Flight-Simulator

Although I've removed most of the code from that and almost started from scratch. So...maybe not so much anymore.

I did have plans to prettify this up a bit (hence including bootstrap, although I'm not doing anything with it) but ran out of time.
I'm going to leave this here for now but I might poke it with a stick at some future point :)
